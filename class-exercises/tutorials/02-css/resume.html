            <p>I am a primarily self taught artist currently studying for my bachelor's. A professional doodler by my own admission. I primarily deal in game design, but I also branch out into character design and comic art on the side.</p>

                    <p>Unrefined Storage Block (USB) is a project in which I sought to explore the idea of a shared user experience. Harkening from the era of public game demos (though they do still exist to some capacity,) the project was displayed as a game in which users would be given a world to explore with no way to reset. Players would pick up the game from where the last user left it and leave it for others to pick up after.</p>
                    <p>The project is planned to continue and be redesigned to fit better for the environment of at home at one's computer, but the display version is still available for download below.</p>
